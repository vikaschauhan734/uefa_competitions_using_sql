## Dataset Overview
The dataset provided consists of five CSV files: Goals, Matches, Players, Stadiums, and Teams. These files contain comprehensive data on various aspects of UEFA competitions, enabling detailed analysis and insights into football dynamics. The project focuses on analyzing these datasets using SQL to answer specific questions about teams, players, goals, matches, and stadiums.

4. Calculate the Average Stadium Capacity in Each Country round it off and sort by the total stadiums in the country.

5. Calculate the Total Goals Scored.

6. Find the total teams that have city in their names

7. Use Text Functions to Concatenate the Team's Name and Country

8. What is the highest attendance recorded in the dataset, and which match (including home and away teams, and date) does it correspond to?

9. What is the lowest attendance recorded in the dataset, and which match (including home and away teams, and date) does it correspond to set the criteria as greater than 1 as some matches had 0 attendance because of covid.

11. Find the total goals scored by each team, distinguishing between home and away goals. Use a CASE WHEN statement to differentiate home and away goals within the subquery

12. Windows function - Rank teams based on their total scored goals (home and away combined) using a window function.In the stadium Old Trafford.

13. TOP 5 players who scored the most goals in Old Trafford, ensuring null values are not included in the result (especially pertinent for cases where a player might not have scored any goals).

14. Write a query to list all players along with the total number of goals they have scored. Order the results by the number of goals scored in descending order to easily identify the top 6 scorers.

15. Identify the Top Scorer for Each Team - Find the player from each team who has scored the most goals in all matches combined. This question requires joining the Players, Goals, and possibly the Matches tables, and then using a subquery to aggregate goals by players and teams.

16. Find the Total Number of Goals Scored in the Latest Season - Calculate the total number of goals scored in the latest season available in the dataset. This question involves using a subquery to first identify the latest season from the Matches table, then summing the goals from the Goals table that occurred in matches from that season.

17. Find Matches with Above Average Attendance - Retrieve a list of matches that had an attendance higher than the average attendance across all matches. This question requires a subquery to calculate the average attendance first, then use it to filter matches.

18. Find the Number of Matches Played Each Month - Count how many matches were played in each month across all seasons. This question requires extracting the month from the match dates and grouping the results by this value. as January Feb march
